# Stock Report Analyzer
This Python notebook retrieves and analyzes the latest SEC 10-Q filing for a given stock symbol, extracting key financial data and generating a PDF report.

## Features
- Fetches the most recent fillngs using the `sec-api` package
- Extracts revenue, net income, financial ratios, MD&A insights, and future outlook
- Uses `langchain` and `sentence-transformers` for document chunking and querying
- Generates a formatted PDF report with `reportlab`

## Roadmap
Do this as python files work on locally with more info generation soon.
